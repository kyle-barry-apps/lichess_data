# Lichess Data
### Here I break things down and add visualizations through seaborn for openings, time controls, and hour of day and day of week.

This is an example of how to use Lichess API data to find trends within your own games (or someone else's). There's a lot more that can be done, but this may be a useful primer. I'm using a Python wrapper called berserk, which is recommended on the Lichess API page here: https://lichess.org/api.
